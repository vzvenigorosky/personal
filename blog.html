                <p>Pathogen evolution is a fast-moving field, but we are often limited by the availability of well-preserved historical samples. What if we could use the millions of tissue samples, stored in archives worldwide, as a biological time machine? Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) samples are a treasure trove of medical history, but they present a formidable challenge: the very chemicals used to preserve the tissue structure wreak havoc on the DNA within, shattering it into tiny, damaged fragments. For years, this degradation made it nearly impossible to sequence whole genomes, especially for fragile bacteria.</p>
                <p>In our recent work, we tackled this problem head-on. We took an FFPE organ sample from a syphilis case dating back to 1947 and applied modern whole-genome enrichment and sequencing techniques. The goal was to see if we could recover a complete genome of the causative bacterium, <em>Treponema pallidum</em>.</p>
                <p>The results were a resounding success. We demonstrated that even after 75 years of storage and chemical degradation, it is possible to reconstruct a complete, high-quality bacterial genome. This is a crucial proof-of-concept. It means that the vast, and largely untapped, collections of FFPE samples in hospitals and research institutions around the world can now be used for in-depth genomic studies. We can now look back in time to trace the evolution of pathogens, study the emergence of antibiotic resistance, and explore the genetic history of human diseases on a scale never before possible. This isn't just about recovering old DNA; it's about opening a new window onto the past to better understand the present and future of infectious disease.</p>

                <p>For 17 years, our team has been on expeditions across North-Eastern Siberia, excavating graves from the 15th to 19th centuries. These archaeological sites hold the stories of the Yakut people, but history is often a mix of myth and fact. We wanted to see if genetics could help separate the two. By analyzing Y-chromosome markers (Y-STRs), which are passed down from father to son, we can trace paternal lineages through time and across geography.</p>
                <p>We successfully analyzed the Y-STRs of 150 ancient and over 500 modern individuals. Our findings were striking. The ancient graves were not a random cross-section of the population. Instead, we found a strong funerary preference for just three specific male lineages, particularly in the 18th century. This wasn't a natural distribution; it was a clear social bias.</p>
                <p>By cross-referencing our genetic data with historical accounts, we were able to connect this pattern to a major historical event: the Russian conquest of Siberia. This period of upheaval allowed certain Yakut clans to rise to new levels of power and influence. It appears these powerful clans were the ones receiving preferential burial, leaving a skewed genetic record in the graves we find today. We could even show that some of the mythical and historical figures from Yakut oral traditions likely belonged to these very lineages. This work provides a rare insight into how a society's burial practices can be biased by its power structures, and how genetics can be used to question and enrich the historical narrative.</p>

                <p>When we think about ancient societies, we often have to guess at their social structures based on artifacts and burial layouts. But what if we could read their family trees directly? Thanks to advances in archaeogenetics, we can now move beyond simply determining broad ancestry and begin to reconstruct detailed kin relationships within ancient cemeteries.</p>
                <p>Our work on Iron Age Scytho-Siberians is a prime example. By analyzing nuclear DNA, which contains genetic information from both parents, we were able to investigate the genetic kinship and population makeup of individuals buried in these ancient sites. This allowed us to identify parent-child pairs, siblings, and more distant relatives.</p>
                <p>The results paint a fascinating picture of a complex society. We found evidence of organized family burials, where close relatives were interred together. This suggests a strong sense of family identity and lineage that persisted after death. Furthermore, by comparing the genetic makeup of different individuals, we could also identify patterns of admixture, revealing how different groups interacted and mixed over time. This level of detail was previously unattainable and demonstrates how genetics can provide a powerful new lens through which to view the social dynamics of past civilizations.</p>

                <p>At first glance, it might seem odd to be talking about syphilis in 2024. Surely this is a disease from the 19th century, right? Romantic poets caught it and died horrible melancholic deaths? You might be forgiven for thinking this, but syphilis is not only still around, it’s actually experiencing a resurgence that cannot be ignored. Let’s go through the epidemiology, the news and the data curated by international institutions, and show how this relic of the past is part of a serious, ongoing health crisis.</p>
                <h2>But don’t we know how to cure it by now?</h2>
                <p>That’s probably the question that should evoke the most outrage. Syphilis is caused by a bacterium called <em>Treponema pallidum pallidum</em>, so it can be cured with antibiotics. Penicillin is often not the drug of choice however, since it’s not produced on as large a scale as it used to, and its administration is sometimes difficult (it has to be injected). The two main alternatives are tetracyclines (like doxycycline) and macrolides (like azithromycin), although the WHO still recommends penicillin, especially if the infection is not recent. Some strains of <em>T. pallidum</em> are known to be resistant to macrolides, and its consistent use since the 1950s has significantly increased the proportion of these strains in the population. Surprisingly, there doesn’t seem to be any strain that has developed a resistance to benzathine penicillin G yet, although scientists have been looking for it.</p>
                <h2>Why is syphilis still here then?</h2>
                <p>So there you are, a new syphilis case comes in, and you know the WHO recommends against azithromycin, and makes it clear that you should use benzathine penicillin G. But maybe your patient is allergic, or maybe you don’t have any penicillin right now. Maybe you can’t be sure the patient will come back every day for the next week to get their injections. Every time a doctor has to take that bet, because they don’t have the resources, there is a chance that a patient gets sent home thinking they’ll be cured when they’re not, and the proportion of the resistant strain increases in the population.</p>

                    <h1 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-slate-900">Not So Simple: The Statistical Hurdles of Forensic Kinship</h1>
                    <p class="text-slate-500 mt-2"><span class="font-semibold">Vincent Zvenigorosky</span> | 8 May 2024</p>
                </div>
                <p>The statistical methods used in forensic genetics, like the Likelihood Ratio (LR), are incredibly powerful tools for determining kinship. They are the backbone of civil, criminal, and identification cases worldwide. However, these tools were designed and calibrated for large, well-surveyed populations like those in Europe and North America. What happens when we apply them to small, isolated, or ancient populations where genetic diversity is different and less understood?</p>
                <p>Our group has extensive experience applying these methods to ancient STR data from archaeological sites. While we successfully reconstructed large genealogies, we often encountered ambiguous results, particularly for second-degree relationships like half-siblings or uncle-nephew pairs. To test this empirically, we collected samples from living, well-defined but genetically distinct populations in North-Eastern Siberia and West Africa. We then ran standard kinship analyses on over 800 pairs of individuals whose relationships were already known.</p>
                <p>The results were eye-opening. For parent-offspring pairs, the method was highly reliable. But for full siblings, the error rate was significant, with up to 29% being misidentified relationships. For half-siblings, it was even worse, reaching a 41% error rate. This means that in these populations, it is statistically very difficult to distinguish a full sibling from a half-sibling, or a half-sibling from an unrelated individual. This has massive implications for ancient DNA studies and modern forensic cases in poorly-defined populations. Our findings call for a more conservative approach, urging the use of additional evidence like complete mitochondrial genomes and Y-chromosome haplotypes whenever possible to confirm kinship, rather than relying on STR data alone.</p>
